# Leiter-R
Solving non-verbal cognition tasks on the Leiter-R. Results published at AAAI-18.

Repo containing code and some results for Leiter-R project. AAAI-18 publication can be found [here](https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17216/15739). Important directories and files:

* ~/retina_newest.py defines the PolAR object that plays a crucial role in the algorithm outlined in the paper
* ~/form_completion is where all the code/results are for the Form Completion Leiter-R subtask. Rudimentary results are found in .csv files. Within each approach directory, you'll find appropriate drivers, sample results, and console readouts. There are three main approaches:
  * Slice-based Approach
  * Subslice-based Approach
  * Hybrid Approach
  
Again, clearer consolidated results can be found in the [AAAI-18 paper](https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17216/15739).
